For nearly two years I worked with teams of GFT software developers in a role of a tech lead. My resposibility included provision of technical guidance, expertise, and mentorship to the development team, fostering effective communication and collaboration within the development team and with other stakeholders, facilitation of knowledge sharing, coordination of tasks, and smooth coordination among team members. I also wrote and reviewed code submissions from team members to ensure adherence to coding standards, best practices, and quality guidelines. I identified and addressed potential issues, provided feedback, and promoted code quality improvement.
